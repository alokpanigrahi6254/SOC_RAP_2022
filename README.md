Heyy, This is a model which can be used for road accident prevention.
To use this just download all the files and just run the main.py file, also instead of Alarm that i am using,
you can use whatever you like, just make sure that you make appropriate naming changes in the main.py file.
Coming to the files eyeclassifier.py is the python file that distinguishes closed and open eyes, main.py file is the main python file
that is run, and the xml files are files outsourced to detect face and eyes.
